# Logo_Gen

Lessons learned:
the first part of this I understood which was just creating the command line prompt and the initial set up of the code and files. I started off strong but really struggled and got really confused when trying to figure out the importing and exporting of the files and where they were going to be used and how to call certain methods or functions. I really understood a lot of the concepts that was needed to be used such as class set ups and inheritance and then using a switch case statement was a little bit of a challenge at first as I am still new to that method but I'm starting to understand it.


Description
challenge was to generate a logo.svg file using a command line prompts, which will allow the user to choose what the shape, shape color, text, and text color will be.
